/*
From the Create Resource Classes lesson:
Next you'll need to create the AdminResource class. The AdminResource should have little to no behavior contained
inside the class and should make use of the Service classes to implement its methods.
The AdminResource will have the following methods:
 */
public class AdminResource {
    // I'm suppose to provide a static reference, but not sure to what just yet
    // private static Collection<>

    public Customer getCustomer(String email) {

    }

    }

    public Collection<IRoom> getAllRooms() {

    }

    public Collection<Customer> getAllCustomers() {

    }

    public void displayAllReservations() {

    }

}
